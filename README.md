### Getting Started

Welcome to the Awesome Cloud Sustainability repository!
When I started looking into sustainability for cloud I found it really hard to get started with all the acronyms used in the sustainability space. 

Where do I start with ***GHG***, ***MMTCDE*** (Sure I knew that it is the abreviation from *"million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents"*) and why it's bad that ***Scope 3*** is excluded?

The best starting point explaining these concepts and ideas to understand more topics and judge some of the claims out there is the free **[Green Software for Practitioners (LFC131)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/)** course by the Linux Foundation.

They explain the core concepts and give insights into more sustainable software, without going too deep. 
Also there is a nice little badge waiting at the end, who can resist that? ;) 

I wish you all the best starting out with your sustainability journey and let's leave the planet just a little better than before.

Best,
